    <h2>Goals and Science Use Cases</h2>
</header>
NSC is meant to be a community release and make the data in the NOAO Archive holdings more
readily available to scientific exploitation.  There are several potential science use cases
of the NSC catalog.
<ul>
   <li><b>Local Group Dwarf Galaxies</b>.
        The Milky Way is orbited by faint dwarf galaxies satellite that can be challenging to detect.
        The best method to discovery these objects has been with resolved stellar populations
        as recently demonstrated by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...807...50B">Bechtol et al. (2015)</a>
        and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..109D">Drlica-Wagner et al. (2015)</a> using
        DECam data from the Dark Energy Survey.  The NSC includes data of resolved stellar populations for regions
        of the sky previously unexplored for dwarf galaxies.
    </li>
    <li><b>Stellar Streams</b>.
        The Milky Way halo hosts a number of stellar streams from tidally stripped galaxies and globular
        clusters.  One of the most famous streams is the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...750...80K">
	Sagittarius stellar stream</a> that stretches more than
        360 degrees around the sky.  Under the currently-favored hierarchical galaxy formation model, galaxies like
        our Milky Way are formed through the continual merging and accretion of smaller galaxies. The streams that
        we currently see are relics of this process.  Studying these streams we can help us understand how our galaxy
        was formed and what its accretion history is.
        The NSC covers regions of the sky that have not yet been explored for stellar streams.
    </li>
    <li><b>Variability</b>.
        Many astronomical objects vary with time either in their brightness or position in the sky.  The temporal
        information in the NSC can be used to investigate the photometric astrometric variability of objects.  The NSC
        has ~10,000 square degrees with tens of exposures, ~1,000 square degrees with hundreds of exposures and ~50 square degrees
	with thousands of exposures.<br>
        <i><u>Variable stars</u></i>, such as RR Lyrae, are essentially standard candles and are used to explore
        stellar structures in the Milky Way halo.<br>
	<i><u>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</u></i> host supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies
	and investigating their photometric variability can be used to study the accretion history of material onto the
	black hole as well as estimate the black hole mass.<br>
	<i><u>Transient events</u></i>, like supernova explosions can be
	used to study interesting astrophysical phenomena as well as the expansion of the universe.<br>
	<i><u>Proper motions</u></i> of objects can be used to study the movements of moving groups of stars
	in the Milky Way galaxy among other things.<br>
	The NSC information can be used to study all of these phenomena across essentially the entire sky.
    </li>
   <li><b>Solar System Objects</b>.
        The NSC temporal information can be used to detect solar system objects and there is a large interest in finding near
        earth objects that could potentially impact the earth.  In addition, there is a big search for Planet 9 and if it
        exists the proof could be lurking inside the NSC.
