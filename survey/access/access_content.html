  </header>

<p>The DES DR1 data are accessible by a variety of means:</p>
    <b>Data Lab Table Access Protocol (TAP) service</b>

<p>TAP provides a convenient access layer to the DES DR1 catalog database.
TAP-aware clients (such as <a
href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>) can point to
<i>http://datalab.noao.edu/tap</i>, select the <i>des_dr1</i> database, and
see the database tables and descriptions.  <i>des_dr1</i> contains fifteen
tables, with <i>main</i> containing the primary object photometry.  For a one-line description of all of the tables, see <a href="index.html#release">the overview page</a>.  To view the schema of the tables, use the <a href="https://datalab.noao.edu/query.php">Query Tool</a>

<p> 
<b>Data Lab Query Manager</b>
<p>The Query Manager is available as part of the Data Lab software
distribution or through the Data Lab Jupyter Notebook server.  The Query Manager client provides a Python API to Data Lab database services.  For the DES DR1 release, these services include anonymous and authenticated access through synchronous and asynchronous queries of the catalog.

<p> 
<b>Image cutouts</b>
<p>The Data Lab Simple Image Access (SIA) service provides a fast way
  to retrieve cutouts from DES DR1 images.  For an example of how to use
  the SIA service,
  look at the example <a
href="https://datalab.noao.edu/desdr1/analysis.php">DES
  Jupyter notebooks</a>.

<p> 
<b>Jupyter Notebook Server</b>
<p>The Data Lab <a href="https://datalab.noao.edu/devbooks">Jupyter Notebook
server</a> contains examples of how to access and visualize the DES DR1
catalog (account creation required).


<!--
<p> 
<b>FTP access</b>
<p>All of the DES DR1 catalog files, images, and products of the photometric
pipeline are available by FTP at
the <a href="">NOAO High Level
Data Products</a> site.
