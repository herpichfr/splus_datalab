The primary goal of the Dark Energy Survey is to measure the cosmic acceleration of the Universe with high precision.  It is using four probes to do so:

<ul>
    <li><b>Supernovae</b>.
DES observes a 30 square degree area, distributed over several fields, with a cadence aimed at discovering thousands of supernovae for use for cosmology.
    </li>
    <li><b>Weak gravitational lensing</b>.
The DES Collaboration is using the galaxies discovered by DES to make three dimensional mass maps through weak lensing, for analysis of the growth of structure.
    </li>
    <li><b>Galaxy clusters</b>.
    Galaxy clusters are another probe of the growth of structure.  Cosmological results from weak lensing and cluster analysis from the Year 1 data are available <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170801530D">here</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</b>.
    The galaxies discovered by DES provide a sample to measure the evolution of the length imprinted on the matter distribution at the time of last scattering after the Big Bang.</li>
</ul>

The DES data will serve many other science cases, which are enabled by the DR1 release.
