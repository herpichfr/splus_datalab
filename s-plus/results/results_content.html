        <b><u>HYDRA II</u></b><br>

        The SMASH data have already produced some exciting results.
        In <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804L...5M">Martin et al. (2015)</a>, we presented the
        discovery of a compact and faint Milky Way satellite, Hydra II (in Field169), with morphological and
        stellar population properties consistent with being a dwarf galaxy (also see
        <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...810...56K">Kirby et al. 2015</a>).
        Interestingly, comparison with simulations suggests that at Hydra II's position in the sky and distance
        of 134 kpc (from blue horizontal branch stars) it could be associated with the Leading Arm of the
        Magellanic Stream, although proper motion information is needed to confirm.  We obtained follow-up
        time-series data on Hydra II to study its variable stars.  This work yielded one RR Lyrae star in Hydra II
        that gave a slightly larger distance of 151 kpc as well as the discovery of dozens of short period variables
        in the field (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151..118V">Vivas et al. 2016</a>).

        <b><u>SMASH 1</u></b><br>
        Further sensitive searching for overdensities in the SMASH data yielded the discovery of a compact and
        very faint (M<sub>V</sub>=-1.0) stellar system (SMASH 1) ~11 degrees away from the LMC.  SMASH 1 is consistent
        with being an old globular cluster in the LMC periphery likely associated with the LMC disk and potentially
        on the verge of tidally disrupting (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...830L..10M">Martin et al. 2016</a>).

        <b><u>Extended LMC stellar populations</u></b><br>
        One of the on-going SMASH projects is to map out the extended stellar populations of the LMC.  An analysis
        of the Hess diagrams indicates that LMC stellar populations can be detected in SMASH data out to 21.1 degrees
        from the LMC center, or ~18.4 kpc, and to surface brightness levels of ~33.3 mag/arcsec<sup>2</sup>
        (D. Nidever et al. 2017, in preparation).

        <b><u>Star Formation Histories</u></b><br>

        One of the main goals of SMASH is to use the data in the central LMC/SMC fields to derive spatially-resolved
        star formation histories.  The Hess diagram of Field55 in Figure X (upper left) is an example of the wealth
        of information in the data.  This field, and other nearby ones, in particular, show two subgiant branches
        which indicates two periods of peak star formation.  This was previously only seen in star formation rate
        diagrams from detailed star formation history modeling
        (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.438.1067M">Meschin et al. 2014</a>), but now is visually clear just
        in the Hess diagrams.  Full star formation history modeling still await computationally intensive artificial
        star tests for the SMASH data, which will be a focus of on-going SMASH processing efforts in the near future.

        <b><u>Citizen Science Cluster Detection</u></b>

        The deep and multi-band data in the main bodies of the Magellanic Clouds are also very useful for
        detecting faint star clusters.  We are in the process of developing a citizen science project (led by L.C.J.)
        based on the SMASH data under the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org">Zooniverse platform</a>  which
        currently has roughly one million users and hosts many citizen science projects in multiple scientific
        disciplines.  The project will be called "The Magellanic Project" and will be similar to the
        <a href="https://www.andromedaproject.org">"The Andromeda Project"</a> of
        <i>HST</i> images of M31.  The citizen scientists will inspect our deep co-add ugriz images
        and visually identify (a) star clusters (open and globular), (b) galaxies behind the LMC/SMC main bodies,
        (c) and new dwarf galaxies of MW or the MCs.  The website is projected to be launched in early 2017.
