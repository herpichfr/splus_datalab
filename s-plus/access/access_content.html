      <h2>Data Access</h2>
  </header>

<p>The SMASH data are accessible by a variety of means:</p>
    <b>Data Lab Table Access Protocol (TAP) service</b>

<p>TAP provides a convenient access layer to the SMASH catalog database.
TAP-aware clients (such as <a
href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>) can point to
<i>http://datalab.noao.edu/tap</i>, select the <i>smash_dr1</i> database, and
see the database tables and descriptions.  <i>smash_dr1</i> contains six
tables: <i>chip, exposure, field, object, source,</i> and <i>xmatch</i>.
These are described in the <a href="smash_schema.php">schema page</a>.

<p> 
<b>Data Lab Query Manager</b>
<p>The Query Manager is available as part of the prototype Data Lab software
distribution.  The Query Manager client provides a Python API to Data Lab
database services.  For the SMASH DR1 release, these services include only
anonymous access through synchronous queries of the catalog made directly to
the database.  The full public release of the Data Lab Query Manager in the
summer of 2017 will include authenticated access, synchronous and
asynchronous queries, TAP queries, personal database storage, and storage
through the Data Lab VOSpace.

<p> 
<b>Image cutouts</b>
<p>The Data Lab Simple Image Access (SIA) service provides a fast way
  to retrieve cutouts from SMASH images.  For an example of how to use
  the SIA service,
  see <a
href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/noao-datalab/notebooks/blob/master/SMASH_dropouts.ipynb">this
  Jupyter notebook</a>.

<p> 
<b>Jupyter Notebook Server</b>
<p>The Data Lab <a href="http://datalab.noao.edu/notebooks">Jupyter Notebook
server</a> contains examples of how to access and visualize the SMASH
catalog.


<p> 
<b>FTP access</b>
<p>All of the SMASH catalog files, images, and products of the photometric
pipeline are available by FTP at
the <a href="ftp://archive.noao.edu/public/hlsp/smash/dr1/">NOAO High Level
Data Products</a> site (easily browsed with Chrome).
