    <p>
        S-PLUS is possible due to a partnership of several Brazilian institutions and the University of La Serena in
        Chile. We warmly thank FAPESP, the primary source of funding (80%) of S-PLUS, which has also provided continuing
        support for the maintenance and operation of the telescope and camera, through project 2009/54202-8. We also
        thank CNPq, ON, UFS, UFSC and ULS for funding and in-kind contributions which were crucial for completing the
        project . We acknowledge support from CEFCA staff for a number of technical issues and most importantly for
        providing a copy of the pipeline for data reduction used for T80-north data, which is also used for T80-South.
        The S-PLUS data are automatically available to the Brazilian and Spanish communities and for any external
        collaborators world wide who may wish to join specific projects, upon request to the PI (Claudia Mendes de
        Oliveira, <a href="mailto:claudia.oliveira@iag.usp.br">claudia.oliveira@iag.usp.br</a>) or project scientist
        (Roderik Overzier, <a href="mailto:overzier@on.br">overzier@on.br</a>).
