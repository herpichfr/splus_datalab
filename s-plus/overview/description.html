<p>The Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) is mapping 9300 square degrees of the Southern sky with an
    optical 12-band narrow and broadband photometric system using a dedicated 0.8m telescope
    (T80S) at Cerro Tololo, Chile. The T80S telescope is equipped with an optical imager, the T80Cam,
    whose detector is a 9232 x 9216 10μmm-pixel array. The telescope plate scale at the detector is 0.55 arcsec/pixel
    and the FoV of the camera is 1.4 x 1.4 deg2. The CCD is read out with 16 amplifiers organized in an 8 x 2 array.
    The unique photometric system used for S-PLUS includes 5 Sloan-like filters and 7 narrow-band filters that cover
    prominent stellar spectral features: [OII], Ca H+K, Hδ, G-band, Mgb Triplet, Hα and the Ca Triplet, allowing
    determination of percent-level accurate photo-z's up to z ~ 0.4 (Molino et al., in prep.) and detailed element
    abundances for millions of sources. The S-PLUS main drives include the large-scale structure of the universe at low
    redshift, the star formation in and around nearby galaxies, quasar searches, transients and variable sources,
    searches for low-metallicity stars and Milky Way science in general. More details about the survey are available in
    the overview S-PLUS paper (Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2019). The first data release (DR1) contains 80 Stripe-82
    fields observed during the scientific validation process plus other 90 fields of the same region obtained during regular
    operation time. Other releases adding entire regions of the southern sky will be followed in the upcoming months.

    The total filter transmission curves, obtained by the convolution of the filter transmission curves with a model of
    the atmospheric transmission (using the ESO sky model calculator version 1.4.3), the efficiency of the CCD and the
    mirror reflectivity curves, are available on the project website:https://github.com/splus-survey/filter_curves.
