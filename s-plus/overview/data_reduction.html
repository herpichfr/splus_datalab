    <h2>Data Reduction</h2>

<p>
    The raw imaging data of S-PLUS are processed daily and data catalogs are generated at the data center, located in
    the T80-South technical room, on Cerro Tololo, Chile.
</p>

<p>
    The S-PLUS raw data are reduced using a version of the same data processing pipeline jype that is used to process
    data for the J-PLUS and the J-PAS surveys, and it is based on the photometric pipeline originally developed for the
    ALHAMBRA survey (see Cristobal-Hornillos et al. 2009; Molino et al. 2014; Benitez et al. 2014) and the CLASH surveys
    (Molino et al. 2017).

The basic reduction strategy consists of four steps:
<ul type="i">
    <li>
        generating a master bias;
    </li>
    <li>
        creating a master flat;
    </li>
    <li>
        reducing the individual frames, and
    </li>
    <li>
        combining the individual frames into the final astrometrically-aligned images.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Bias frames are obtained every night and twilight flats are obtained whenever the sky is clear, at dawn and
    at dusk. Twilight flats work well for our purposes. Bias and twilight flat fields are stable over a period of about
    a month and therefore master bias and master flats are obtained for such a period, encompassing the observations of
    the object. Master flats are obtained for each filter. Only flat fields with counts between 8000 and 45000 counts
    are used. Overscan subtraction, trimming and bias subtraction is applied to each individual flat field. Master flats
    are then created by obtaining, for each pixel, the median value with 3 sigma clipping, of all usable flats of a
    given filter, after scaling each image by its mode. This is performed using the task imcombine of iraf with options
    median, sigclip, scale=mode and zero=none. Finally the master-flats are normalized to have a median of unity.

    The reduction of individual images consists of applying the overscan subtraction, trimming, bias subtraction and
    masterflat division. Then cosmetic corrections (removing satellite tracks and cosmic rays) and fringing subtraction
    is performed. Satellite track and cosmic ray subtraction is performed using either SatDetect in the first case and
    LACosmic (van Dokkum 2001) or retina filter in the second case, both from SExtractor. Fringing frames are obtained
    by combining the final individual frames that suffer from fringing, usually only in the z filter. The fringing
    patterns are stable over several months, so a single fringing frame is made by combining all images over such a
    period which do not have any bright objects. The last step is, then, the combination of the individual images, which
    is done by obtaining the median, with 3 sigma clipping, pixel by pixel, for typically three images of each field and
    filter. This is performed using the task imcombine of iraf with options median, sigclip, scale=none and zero=mode.
