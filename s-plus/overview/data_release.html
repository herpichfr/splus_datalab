<p>
    As explained in Mendes de Oliveira+2018, the procedure adopted in S-PLUS for the catalog production is similar to
    that thoroughly explained in Molino+14 for the ALHAMBRA survey (Moles et al, 2008). The S-PLUS photometric pipeline
    is based on the <a href="https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor">SExtractor software</a>.
    Photometric catalogs are constructed in double-image
    mode to perform multi-band aperture-matched photometry. Detection images are created as a weighted-combination of
    the reddest (griz) broad-band filters to maximize the detectability of faint (or low-surface brightness) sources and
    to enhance the definition of the photometric apertures. An empirical noise characterization is done beforehand on an
    image-by-image basis, to account for correlations among adjacent pixels during image reduction process (Molino+14).
    Magnitudes for non-detected sources on individual images are set to m=99. and corresponding uncertainties replaced
    by upper-limits. Photometric zero-point calibrations have been performed for every pointing using a novel technique
    optimized for wide-field multi-band photometric surveys (Sampedro et al, in prep.). The technique uses a combination
    of libraries of stellar models and the stellar locus of main sequence stars, applied to typically ~1500 stars per
    field, bringing all zero-points to a typical error of 1-2%.

<p>
    As explained in Sampedro et al., (in prep.), the catalog includes both astrometric, morphologic,
    photometric and photo-z information for all detected sources in the S-PLUS detection images. Astrometric as well as
    morphological information is extracted from detection images: celestial coordinates (RA, Dec) in the J2000 system,
    physical position on the CCD (X,Y), photometric aperture size (ISOarea), the signal-to-noise (s2nDet; defined as
    SExt_FLUX_PETRO/SExt_FLUXERR_PETRO on the detection image), compactness (FWHM and MUMAX)
    , basic shape parameters (A, B & THETA), the fraction-of-light radii (FlRadDet) and Kron apertures (KrRadDet).
     We have also included the standard <a href="https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor">SeXtractor</a>
    photometric Flags (PhotoFlag). The meaning of the flag's number is the following:
</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
1: The object has neighbors, bright and close enough to significantly bias the MAG_AUTO photometry, or bad pixels,
2: The object was originally blended with another one,
4: At least one pixel of the object is saturated,
8: The object is truncated (too close to an image boundary),
16: Object's aperture data are incomplete or corrupted,
32: Object's isophotal data are incomplete or corrupted,
64: A memory overflow occurred during the deblending,
128: A memory overflow occurred during the extraction.
</pre>

<p>
Objects with a different flag's number may suffer from a combination of the already mentioned flags, being the number the sum of the different flags.
</p>

<p>
    The catalog contains a triple photometry where magnitudes (& uncertainties) are named according to the filter's
    name and the adopted photometric aperture. Here we provide an example for clarifications: F660_auto, F660_petro &
    F660_aper correspond to the AB magnitudes for the F660 narrow-band filter, where “auto” refers to the total
    (restricted) apertures used to derive photo-z estimations, “petro” to the total (moderate) apertures used to derive
    absolute magnitudes and stellar masses and “aper” to the standard circular 3”-diameter apertures (see Molino+16,
    Molino+18, for more information). Photometric uncertainties take the same name (as magnitudes) but adding the prefix
    “d”): “dF660_auto”, “dF660_petro” & “dF660_aper”.
</p>
<p>
    An estimate of the signal-to-noise for every detection, within each one of the three apertures, is also provided as
    “s2n_F660_auto”, “s2n_F660_petro” & “s2n_F660_aper”, defined as explained before for the detection image. For each
    sets of magnitudes, photometric uncertainties are empirically corrected in all the 12 bands. Whenever a source was
    not detected, its magnitude was set to 99. and its photometric uncertainty replaced by a 2-σ upper limit. Magnitudes
    are corrected from galactic extinction using Schlegel+98.
</p>
<p>
    The catalog also includes a photometric redshift estimate for every source using a new version of the BPZ code
    (Benítez 2000) optimized for galaxies in the local Universe (Molino et al, in prep.). “zb” correspond to the most
    likely value (i.e., peak) and “zb_Min” and “zb_Max” represent the lower and upper limits for the first peak within a
    1σ interval (i.e., ∆z = 0.02x(1 + z). Based on the most likely redshift, a spectral-type classification is also
    provided by “Tb”, where its number refers to the selected template. “Odds” gives the amount of redshift probability
    enclosed around the main peak and “χ2” the reduced chi-squared from the comparison between observed and predicted
    fluxes according to the selected template and redshift. An estimation of the stellar-mass content (in units of
    log10(M⊙)) is given by “Stell_Mass”. Absolute magnitudes in the Johnson B-band (“M_B”) are estimated for each
    detection according to its most likely redshift and spectral-type.
